# coronavirus-tracker
 An API to track the latest active cases around the world is developed here. The API is able to provide JSON data containing the state, country, and its latest active cases. It also provides total cases worldwide and individual cases in each country. Java Springboot framework is used for this project and the API is tested using the Postman API platform. The project was made in order to learn the fundamentals of the spring-boot framework and API.
 
 The screenshots of outputs from Postman API platform are provided below
